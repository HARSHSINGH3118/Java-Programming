Hello sir, this is Harsh Singh, and I am currently pursuing  Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from SRM University AP. I have a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming. I have worked on software development, particularly full-stack development, and machine learning research.

I recently worked as a Full Stack Developer Intern at Tipfox Travel India. I worked basically on search engine optimisation - increased - (30%)

and worked with the team to optimize front-end and back-end using React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
